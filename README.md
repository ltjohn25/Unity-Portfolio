# Unity-Portfolio
An ongoing sample of my knowledge of Unity
The games is an ARPG style game along the vein of Diablo
I am not an artist but am trying to find one to help me add details.
There are Player and NPC protoypes in C#. The player is now moving around as you click. 
The NPC has logic for "patroling" via waypoints. He will also aggro when the player comes to close 
and chase the player.
The starting level is currently in progress the plan is to set up the inital level which begins in a dungeon
further updates to follow
